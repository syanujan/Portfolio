This portfolio holds some of my recent Python, SQL, PowerBI, and Tableau projects.

The python projects mainly compose of dataset analyses and some machine learning models, including feature engineering for better model accuracy.
The SQL projects consist of query code for various datasets. The queries compose of ETL, and some queries are written to produce results that can be used in later visualizations

The PowerBI and Tableau projects are built from the prior analyses in SQL, as well as Power Query transformations inside the PowerBI software itself.
